A nice gui Python program that will download YouTube video files directly from a youTube video URL

you will also need ffmpeg installed on your pc and the proper path so that if you type ffmpeg at the cmd prompt you get a response from the program.

On top of that you need to do this in python:
pip install ffmpeg-python

note that the pip command does not install ffmpeg but only sort of links it. You still need ffmpeg on your pc at say C:\ffmpeg\bin as the path.
Try this link if you have proplems
